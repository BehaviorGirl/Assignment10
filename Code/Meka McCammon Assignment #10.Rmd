This notebook includes the analysis of Johnson Elementary ELA Data for assignment # 10


#### 1. Write a script to import and tidy the Johnson Elementary Project Data
```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```
```{r include=FALSE}
# Read in the data, skip the first 4 rows, specify Room as a factor and name the columns
jep <- read_csv(here("Data","Johnson Elementary ELA Project.csv"), skip = 4,
                col_types = cols(Room = col_factor()),
                col_names = c("Room", "ID", "Tardies;Absences","Q1", "Q2", "Q3", "Q4"))
```
```{r include=FALSE}
# next gather the quarters to long format, and label the new columns to refer to quarter and the rating
(gather.quarters <- jep %>%
  gather(`Q1`, `Q2`, `Q3`, `Q4`,
         key = "Quarter",
         value = "Rating"))
```
```{r include=FALSE}
# separate tardies and absences into their own columns
(separate.attendance <- gather.quarters %>%
  separate(`Tardies;Absences`,into = c("Tardies", "Absences"), convert = TRUE))
```
```{r include=FALSE}
# Fill the room number down each section 
(fill.room <- separate.attendance %>% 
  fill(Room))
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
#  remove cells that say NA associated with each Room by ID 
(tidy.jep <- fill.room %>% 
   drop_na(Room:Absences))
# * another way to do this filter(!is.na(ID))
```


#### 2. Obtain summary statistics for the number of tardies and absencnes in each room 

```{r echo=TRUE}
(summary.jep <- tidy.jep %>%
  group_by(Room) %>%
  summarise(tardy.mean = mean(Tardies),tardy.sd = sd(Tardies), tardy.median = median(Tardies), tardy.quantile1 = quantile(Tardies, probs = 0.25, na.rm = TRUE), tardy.quantile3 = quantile(Tardies, probs = 0.75, na.rm = TRUE), absence.mean = mean(Absences),absence.sd = sd(Absences), absence.median = median(Absences), absence.quantile1 = quantile(Absences, probs = 0.25, na.rm = TRUE), absence.quantile3 = quantile(Absences, probs = 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)))
```


#### 3. Here are the frequencies of missing data points for each quarter by room 
```{r echo=TRUE}
(missing.quarters <- tidy.jep %>%
  group_by(Room,Quarter) %>%
  count(sum(is.na(Rating))))
```

#### 4. Here is a line graph of the median trends across the fourth quarter by class
```{r echo=TRUE}
median.quarters <- tidy.jep %>%
  group_by(Quarter,Room) %>%
  summarize(quarter.medians = median(Rating, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= Quarter, y = quarter.medians, group = Room)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = Room), show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(vars(Room), nrow = 2) +
  labs(x = "Quarter", y = "Median ELA Ratings",
      title = "Johnson Elementary ELA 5th Grade Ratings",
      subtitle = "Ratings Across Four Quarters by Classroom")

median.quarters

  
```
#### 5. construct a graph that compares carriers in terms of the proportion of 2013 flights that arrived on time when traveling from New York City to Atlanta. 

```{r include=FALSE}
library(here)
# First filter by year destination and origin

flights <- read_csv(here("Data","NYC Flights 2013.csv")) 
(flights2013 <- filter(flights, year == 2013, dest == "ATL")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay))
```
```{r include=FALSE}

# Filter the 2013 flights from NYC to ATL that arrived on time or early 

(on.time.arrival <-(flights2013 %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
   filter(arr_delay <= 0 & arr_delay > 0)))
count(on.time.arrival)
```
```{r include=FALSE}

# Next filter the 2013 flights from NYC to ATL that arrived late 
(late.arrival <-(flights2013 %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
   filter(arr_delay > 0)))
```
```{r}
# see grammar of graphics script for creating the proportions

arrivals <- flights2013 %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  filter(arr_delay >0) %>%
  ggplot(flights2013, mapping = aes(x = carrier, fill = arr_delay)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")

```
